You can now use Codex in VS Code with LLM Foundry. Here are a few simple things to try.

1. Copy **text** documents into the folder and prompt Codex to "Summarize these documents".
2. Copy **code** files into the folder and prompt Codex to "Explain this code".
3. Copy **Excel** files into the folder and prompt Codex to "Write code to analyze this data".

## 6. Install Python

Open the Windows search bar and search for "Python". Install any of the Python versions from the Microsoft Store. This will allow Codex to run Python code locally.
