> Here are system prompts for leading LLM chatbots. Analyze the prompts very carefully and identify the common prompt engineering techniques across many of these prompts. By prompt engineering techniques, we mean specific instructions (e.g. providing the current date, mentioning the name of the model, telling it not to help with criminal activities) as well as style of instruction (e.g. providing examples).
>
> List every single technique you can identify as bullets. For each technique, add sub-bullets mentioning each chatbot that uses it, citing verbatim from the system prompt the relevant section.

... and then...

> Review the above list very carefully, checking for mistakes. If there are any models that use the technique that are not mentioned, add it to the list. If any of the mentioned examples are incorrect, remove it. If there are any new techniques, add them.
>
> Drop any techniques that are used only by one LLM chatbot - but double-check to ensure no other LLM chatbot uses the technique before dropping it.
>
> Sort in descending order of frequency of use and mention the number of LLM chatbots that use the technique in brackets. E.g. "1. Declare model identity & maker (5/5 models)"
